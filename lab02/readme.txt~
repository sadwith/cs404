	Lab02 is related to understanding of the working of external leds and its connectivity with the Beaglebone. This lab aims at successfully making a led glow and blink based on input giving to a push button.
	
	The leds were wired to the Beaglebone as given in the figure of the lab.By means of a push button, the led is made to glow by giving appropriate output to the led when input from push button is given to the beaglebone.
	The push button is connected to 5v supply on one side and input pin on beaglebone on the other side.initially when the button is open, the circuit is open and no input(or 0 logic) is sent to the beaglebone.When Button is pressed the circuit is complete and input of 5v(or 1 logic) is sent  to the beaglebone.When this logic is detected a corresponding voltage of 5v is sent to the Led, making it glow.
	
	This lab is quite simple and could be easily understood. The proper usage of the push button has been learnt in this lab.
