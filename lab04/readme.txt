# Your code looks like mine, no changes were made.
# The lab required a switch to be attached and 'something different'.

	Lab04 aims at completely manipulating the LED Matrix in order to display required patterns and operate on the matrix by means of other devices like range finders, ultrasonic sensors and joysticks.
	
	The Wiring is done as given in the diagram.The bicolor 8X8 LED Matrix is manipulated by means of hex addressing modes.Giving a particular hex code activates a particular led block. Hex when written in binary occupies 4 bits. Therefore 2 hex digits give 8 bits, which represent the 8 blocks in a row. The blocks to light are given binary 1 while others are given 0 to indicate what led's are to be lighted.
	In the same way we controlled individual led's with the above mentioned devices, we are going to activate the required leds to get the desired display.
	
	This lab is related to manipulation of Display unit LED Matrix. It proved to be quite an interesting lab work, but it took a lot of time to undersand how the LED Matrix works.
