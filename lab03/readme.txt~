	Lab03 is related to the understanding of the manipulation of analog input and output by means of a potentiometer and control the brightness of an led by means of PWM.
	
	The connection are made as given in the diagram. The analog VCC given is 1.8V.The analog input given to the beaglebone is taken from the middle pin of the potentiometer. The potentiometer works on the basis of variable resistance. the potential difference across the resistor till the point of contact is taken as the input to the Beaglebone.According to the value read, we can manipulate the output of the led when connect to the analog pins. We use the PWM pins to manipulate the output across the LED to make it Glow or Fade according to the analog input obtained through the potentiometer
	
	This lab was quite interesting and the analog manipulation was properly understood. This is quite an important part of the Beaglebone operations that needed to be understood perfectly.
